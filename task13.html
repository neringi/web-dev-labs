        <dt>Policy implementation in the last year</dt>
        <dd>Last year, the Committee set out 25 headline 
        policy actions for the year ahead. Twelve months later, 
        only one has been delivered in full. Ten of the required 
        actions have not shown even partial progress.</dd>

        <dt>Underlying progress</dt>
        <dd>The Committee also monitor indicators of 
        underlying progress such as improvements to insulation of 
        buildings and the market share of electric vehicles. Only 
        seven out of 24 of these were on track in 2018.</dd>

        <dt>Projected progress</dt>
        <dd>The Government's own projections demonstrate that 
        its policies and plans are insufficient to meet the 
        fourth or fifth carbon budgets (covering 2023-2027 and 
        2028-2032).</dd>
