        <blockquote>The power of the Web is in its universality. 
            <em>Access by everyone</em> regardless of disability is an 
            essential aspect. â€” <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, W3C Director and 
            inventor of the World Wide Web (1997)</blockquote>
        <p>The World Wide Web 
            is a hypertext-based, platform-independent means of 
            displaying text, graphic, audio, and video information 
            over the Internet. Twenty million people now use the 
            Internet, and the number of World Wide Web sites is well 
            over one million and growing rapidly.</p>
